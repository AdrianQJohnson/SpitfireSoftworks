   <p>In our experience, there are a lot of mobile developers who are phenomenal programmers
 and graphic artisits. The issue comes to the business side of development. These programmers have
 spent thousands of hours learning their skills, and find themselves lost when dealing with
 app stores, self-employment taxes, and federal/state taxes, forms, and regulations.</p>
   <p>Our goal is to reach all software developers who do not have access or the ability
 to publish their apps and games to the mobile appstores- such as Apple App Store and Google Play
 -and allow them to do what they do best, programming and design, while we do what we do best,
 publishing and monitoring published apps.</p>
